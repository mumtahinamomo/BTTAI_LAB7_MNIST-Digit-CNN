The program builds a CNN for digit recognition using Keras. It loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset, reshapes the images for CNN input, and defines a model with multiple convolutional layers and max-pooling for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. The CNN is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset to predict handwritten digits.
